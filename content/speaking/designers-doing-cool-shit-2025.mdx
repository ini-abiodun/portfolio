Hosted an intimate gathering of designers building with AI outside of work—shipping things, experimenting, and learning in public together.

What started as a casual mention at Intercom's AI Design Meetup became a deep evening of sharing. Sakky B offered to host, and the conversations went places I didn't expect. Product concepts with full technical architecture. Techniques we're using in our work—role playing with AI personas, feedback on visual direction, branding choices, market positioning. Safe conversations about what's working and what's not.

I left feeling nourished and convinced we need more nights like this. If you're interested in joining our next Designers Doing Cool Shit gathering, reach out at tbc@iniabiodun.com.
