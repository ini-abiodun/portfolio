Spoke at UX London 2025 on day three, exploring the power of "pre-work"—the strategic groundwork before presenting design solutions.

Designers often feel like order takers, struggling to gain buy-in for their ideas without truly influencing key stakeholders or the product strategy. This talk explored how to build rapport, understand organisational dynamics, and tailor communication to influence decision-makers effectively.

Using real-world examples and actionable frameworks, I shared how designers can become more effective communicators and drive meaningful change within their organisations.
