Speaking at Throughline Conference 2026 on how to stay grounded as AI reshapes design at a dizzying pace.

New tools promise speed and precision, but they also change the nature of our roles—as well as how teams relate, make decisions, and build trust. The ability to experiment and make meaning with AI is fast becoming a new baseline for design practice. Beneath the tooling and the hype, the work that holds teams together is emotional literacy, curiosity, and strategic translation. The kind of pre-work that keeps design human.

Together, we'll explore how influence, leadership, and collaboration have been rewired inside modern teams. We'll examine how the work beneath the work—listening, translating, aligning, questioning, both between humans as well as between humans and machines—is what will allow new technology to create genuine progress.

The future of design won't belong to the fastest teams, but to the ones who move together, guided by curiosity, even as the world around them accelerates.
