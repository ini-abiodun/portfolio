Organised and hosted Intercom's first AI Design Meetup in London: an evening exploring how designers are leveraging AI to accelerate prototyping, bridge the code gap, and push creative limits.

Speakers included Nathalie K. (Figma), Heldiney Pereira (Monzo), Ioana Teleanu (ex-Miro), Domingo Widen (Intercom), James Cash (Intercom), and Daria V. (Intercom). Punchy talks, live demos, and plenty of "wait, can you show that again?" moments as we explored what AI-powered design means today.

The energy in the room was electric. Designers from across London came together to share what's working, what's breaking, and where this is all heading. Planning more of these.
