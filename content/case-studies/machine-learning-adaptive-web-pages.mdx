### Building Fin's Acquisition Engine

Led the creation of Intercom's first adaptive direct-response landing page system for Fin AI Agent. Over six months, this evolved from urgent 0→1 builds into a CMS-driven, ML-powered acquisition system used by Sales, Demand Gen, and Product Marketing. Cross-functional partnership with Engineering, Growth, and GTM.

## Outcome

- 70% of paid traffic now lands on DRLP system
- 10%+ average CTA rate across pages (2.5× the main site)
- System now used across web, sales, product marketing, and growth
- Foundation of fin.ai's web design system

## Challenge

Fin AI Agent needed its own home, separate from Intercom's main site. The GTM team suddenly had no dedicated fin.ai website, no acquisition surfaces, and no performance-ready design system. We needed a fully functioning DRLP ecosystem within weeks.

Different queries ("AI agent", "AI customer service", "live chat software") produced wildly different intent. Sales and Demand Gen needed pages they could modify without design input. ML risk signals had to influence page behaviour live.

## Strategic Approach

### Phase 1: 0→1 DRLP System

Designed and shipped 12 pages in two weeks with unified structure, performance-first interaction patterns, high-velocity components later ported to Sanity, and CTA logic optimised around Fin's two revenue drivers (trial + demo).

### Phase 2: ML Adaptive Pages

The most innovative part. Using internal tech built by a brilliant product engineer, the design became an adaptive layer that could identify high-risk or high-value traffic in real time, adjust layout, ordering, and messaging, and personalise content blocks—all to drive trial/demo conversions.

### Phase 3: Componentising into Sanity

Paired with another designer to rebuild DRLP components into a CMS system that GTM teams could use with reduced design and engineering handoff. This included layout variants, plan comparison blocks, credibility sections, testimonials, ML conditional content buckets, and mobile-first variants.
